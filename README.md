# Homework - 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor 

## Description
This is a homework assignment where I refacted existing code to increase not only the accessibility of the webpage but that of the source code as well. I did this by updating the source code with semantic HTML elements, updating the structure of the HTML elements to follow a logical structure, adding accessible alt attributes to image elements, updating heading attributes so they fall in sequential order, and adding a concise, descriptive title element.
